 Making small progress continuously will lead to a great success. I hold a strong belief that my future self will express gratitude towards my present self for the hard work I put in. My peers are well aware of my unyielding commitment towards achieving my goals. With persistence and passion being the driving forces behind my actions, I am confident that I will be able to succeed in full-time opportunity that I undertake this year.

Currently I am a masterâ€™s student at Duke University in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am skilled in C/C++, Python, Java. Also, I have gained a solid knowledge of programming with Django, PostgreSQL, Docker and Git from projects and courses. In addition, I'm also working on some independent designs and group projects that are giving me firsthand experience with full-stack software development and network programming.

During my internship in NIO Inc. as a testing engineer and data scientist, I engaged in autonomous driving tests and obtained understanding of vehicle system design in hardware and software. To embrace new cutting-edge technologies, I transferred to Digital Cockpit teams to learn more about AI and Natural Language Processing. Working as an intern data analyst, I oversaw database management and optimization. I enjoyed working with lots of talented and innovative teams there.

I love cooperation and teamwork. Working in a multicultural team can present unique challenges and opportunities for improving efficiency and creativity. I am eager to embrace these challenges and develop strategies to optimize team performance. As such, I am seeking to embark on a new professional journey with a forward-thinking company that prioritizes the latest technology and innovation.
